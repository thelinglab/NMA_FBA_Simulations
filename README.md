# README

This code runs the normalization model of attention (NMA) simulations reported in our paper: Foster JJ, Ling S (2022). Feature-based attention multiplicatively scales the fMRI-BOLD contrast-response function.

This code was adapted from code provided by Reynolds and Heeger, which is available [here](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/index.php?page=software&id=attentionModel). If you use or adapt the code in this repository, you should credit them for their work (see README.rtf and COPYRIGHT.rtf from their repository)

`Figure7a` generates the plots shown in Figure 7a.
